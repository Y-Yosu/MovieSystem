# Project Description
In this project, we will implement an online movie rental system. The users of this system can be customers or employees. The system lets the users search the movies by title, director, genre, production year, etc. If any desired movie does not exist, the customers can create a request for the absent film. The employees can register new movies and delete the customer accounts. Users can rate the movies and write reviews. Users can also add other users as friends and recommend movies to them. User accounts should show previously rented movies, currently rented movies, movie ratings, reviews, and the movies that their friends suggest.
